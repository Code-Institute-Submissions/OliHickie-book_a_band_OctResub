Book a Band is an e-commerce website designed to help users plan and book musical entertainment for their wedding day. The site offers users an easy booking system which allows them to book a variety of acts, as well as view all bookings in one easy place. 

The website is built using the Django framework alongside Bootstrap and jQuery, with the checkout process provided by Stripe. Static files are hosted by Amazon Web Services and the site is deployed on Heroku. This website was created as part of my Full Stack Web Developer Diploma with Code Institute.

# User Experience

The layout of the site is clear, clean and relatively simple. The idea behind this is for users to understand the functionality of the site and navigate to their desired destination quickly. The site will offer a number of different acts and to make the searching easier, there are a number of different categories that the user may reduce the amount of search results and, in turn, find an appropriate band or act. 
The checkout process is quick and clear, made easy by the use of Stripe. Once all bands or acts have been paid for, the booking is marked as confirmed. 
Many of the site actions are supported by notifications at the top of the screen to confirm the users actions and keep a clean feel to the sight.

## Design

The site is aimed at those planning on getting married, although a future step would be to open the site up to attract people planning events in general. With the focus, for now, being on weddings, the color scheme, imagery and design reflects this.  

### Color Scheme

![Image of color scheme](media/babcolor1.png)

I used a lot of pinks in the site as a soft color and that often associated with weddings. THe two contrasting shades of pink are used as both backdrops as well as for the logo, text and buttons. Blue offered a nice contrast to this so if often used for headings and bold text. 
I wanted to keep the color scheme relatively simple as there is a lot of color introduced to pages through busy imagery. 

### Typography

Throughout the site I used two types of font, both downloaded from Google Fonts. For titles and large text, including the logo, I used Abril Fatface and for the rest of the site I used Playfair Display, a very easy to read font, which has a smart and fun look about it.
